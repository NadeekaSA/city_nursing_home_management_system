                                                            # City Nursing Home Management System

A Java desktop application designed to manage the operations of a nursing home.

## Features

- User Management (Cashier, Consultant, Manager roles)
- Patient Database Management
- Billing and Financial Operations (Cashier System)
- Consultant System for medical staff
- Manager System for administrative tasks

## Technologies Used

- Java
- NetBeans IDE

## How to Run

1. Open the project in NetBeans IDE.
2. Locate the `CityNursingH.java` file in the `src/citynursingh/` directory.
3. Right-click on `CityNursingH.java` and select "Run File" (or use the appropriate NetBeans command to run the main class).

## Project Structure
-   **`src/`**: Contains all the Java source code.
    -   **`citynursingh/`**: GUI classes for the main application window (`SystemHome.java`) and specific user dashboards (`ManagerSys.java`, `CashierSys.java`, `ConsultantSys.java`). Also includes the main class `CityNursingH.java` (though it appears to be unused as `SystemHome` has its own `main` method).
    -   **`BLL/` (Business Logic Layer)**: Contains classes for business rules and calculations, such as `BillCalculation.java`.
    -   **`DB/` (Data Base Layer)**: Contains classes responsible for data interaction, primarily reading from and writing to text files. Includes `AddUser.java`, `PatientDB.java`, and the `User.java` data model.
-   **`build/`**: Typically contains compiled `.class` files (often generated by IDEs like NetBeans).
-   **`users.txt`**: Stores user credentials in the format: `username,password,role`.
-   **`patients.txt`**: Stores patient records in the format: `name,age,gender,category,contact`.
-   **`consultants.txt`**: Stores consultant availability status and timestamps, e.g., `consultantID is online at YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
-   **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.                                                                                              
-   **`build.xml`**: Ant build script, commonly used with NetBeans projects.
-   **`nbproject/`**: NetBeans project-specific files.
-   **`manifest.mf`**: Manifest file, often used for packaging JAR files.
-   ## Project Overview

The system is initiated through the `SystemHome` class, which presents a login screen. Based on the credentials provided (validated against `users.txt`), the user is redirected to their respective dashboard:

-   **Manager Dashboard (`ManagerSys.java`):**
    -   View patient bookings.
    -   Add new patients.
    -   Calculate patient bills.
    -   Search for consultants.
    -   Create new user accounts (Cashier or Consultant).
-   **Cashier Dashboard (`CashierSys.java`):**
    -   View patient bookings.
    -   Add new patients.
    -   Calculate patient bills.
    -   Search for consultants.
-   **Consultant Dashboard (`ConsultantSys.java`):**
    -   Set their availability status (online/offline), which is logged in `consultants.txt`.
    -   View patient details relevant to their specialization (searches `patients.txt` based on category).

Data is stored in plain text files, acting as simple databases. `PatientDB.java` handles operations related to `patients.txt` and `consultants.txt`, while `AddUser.java` manages `users.txt`. `BillCalculation.java` in the BLL package computes bills based on predefined service categories and a fixed tax rate.
